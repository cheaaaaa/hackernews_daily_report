That seems like an area that Claude Code has really optimized for.<p>I have high hopes for o3 and o4-mini as models so I hope that other tests show better results!

It combines models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google to achieve better results, more reliable agent behavior, better cost efficiency, and better performance than is possible by using only a single provider’s models.<p>I believe it is now one of the best tools available for working on large tasks in real world codebases with AI. It has an effective context window of 2M tokens, and can index projects of 20M tokens and beyond using tree-sitter project maps (30+ languages are supported). It can effectively find relevant context in massive million-line projects like SQLite, Redis, and Git.<p>A bit more on some of Plandex’s key features:<p>- Plandex has a built-in diff review sandbox that helps you get the benefits of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project. By default, all changes accumulate in the sandbox until you approve them. The sandbox is version-controlled. You can rewind it to any previous point, and you can also create branches to try out alternative approaches.<p>- It offers a ‘full auto mode’ that can complete large tasks autonomously end-to-end, including high level planning, context loading, detailed planning, implementation, command execution (for dependencies, builds, tests, etc.), and debugging.<p>- The autonomy level is highly configurable. You can move up and down the ladder of autonomy depending on the task, your comfort level, and how you weigh cost optimization vs. effort and results.<p>- Models and model settings are also very configurable. There are built-in models and model packs for different use cases. You can also add custom models and model packs, and customize model settings like temperature or top-p. All model changes are version controlled, so you can use branches to try out the same task with different models. The newly released OpenAI models and the paid Gemini 2.5 Pro model will be integrated in the default model pack soon.<p>- It can be easily self-hosted, including a ‘local mode’ for a very fast local single-user setup with Docker.<p>- Cloud hosting is also available for added convenience with a couple of subscription tiers: an ‘Integrated Models’ mode that requires no other accounts or API keys and allows you to manage billing&#x2F;budgeting&#x2F;spending alerts and track usage centrally, and a ‘BYO API Key’ mode that allows you to use your own OpenAI&#x2F;OpenRouter accounts.<p>I’d love to get more HNers in the Plandex Discord (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;plandex-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;plandex-ai</a>). Please join and say hi!<p>And of course I’d love to hear your feedback, whether positive or negative. Thanks so much!",

It seems Claude Code does not do that, which is part of the reason it racks up a (relatively) large bill for long work sessions (that and the cost of sonnet-3.7).<p>I bounce back and forth between Aider, Claude Code, and Simon Willison&#x27;s LLM tool (&quot;just&quot; a GOOD wrapper for using LLMs at the CLI, unlike the other two which are agent-y.) LLM is my favorite because I usually don&#x27;t need&#x2F;want full autonomy, but Claude Code has started to win me over for straightforward stuff. Plandex looks cool enough to throw into the rotation!<p>My main concern at this point is that I use a Mac and as far as I understand it Docker containers can have pretty poor performance on the Mac, so I&#x27;m wondering if that will carry over to performance of Plandex. (I don&#x27;t use Docker at all so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s outdated info.)",

For example, very few people have any real interest in driving a car at 200 MPH, but Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches are widely understood as desirable cars, because the people who <i>are</i> into cars like those marques.<p>If you&#x27;re designing a consumer-oriented web service like Netflix or Spotify or Instagram, you will probably add in some user analytics service, and use the insights from that analysis to inform future development. However, that analysis will aggregate its results over all your users, and won&#x27;t pick out the enthusiasts, who will shape discourse and public opinion about your service. Consequently, your results will be dominated by people who don&#x27;t really have an opinion, and just take whatever they&#x27;re given.<p>Think about web browsers. The first popular browser was Netscape Navigator; then, Internet Explorer came onto the scene. Mozilla Firefox clawed back a fair chunk of market share, and then Google Chrome came along and ate everyone&#x27;s lunch. In all of these changes, most of the userbase didn&#x27;t really care what browser they were using: the change was driven by enthusiasts recommending the latest and greatest to their less-technically-inclined friends and family.<p>So if you develop your product by following your analytics, you&#x27;ll inevitably converge on something that just shoves content into the faces of an indiscriminating userbase, because that&#x27;s what the median user of any given service wants. (This isn&#x27;t to say that most people are tasteless blobs; I think everyone is a connoisseur of <i>something</i>, it&#x27;s just that for any given individual, that <i>something</i> probably isn&#x27;t <i>your</i> product.) But who knows - maybe that really <i>is</i> the most profitable way to run a tech business.",

Over time, other companies understood that they were underpricing their content and Netflix was reaping the benefits. Once external forces adjusted, the TV&#x2F;film bidding wars began. Today, netflix doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much content as they used to have.<p>That risk (losing all content and facing extinction) is what pushed Netflix in the direction of being a content-producer, rather than a content aggregator. I agree with everyone&#x27;s points on the influence of the median user in diluting the quality of the content Netflix produces, but that&#x27;s not the only forced that pushed us here. Spotify faced a similar crossroads and decided to broaden beyond music once they started losing bidding wars for licensing.<p>Being a faster horse wasn&#x27;t an option available to either Netflix or Spotify; there is no path for a &#x27;better 2012 version of netflix or spotify&#x27; in 2025. They each had to change species or die, and they chose to keep living.",

If you perceive having a fantastic experience on the site by just going there, finding something you enjoy watching, and leaving... they win.

Multi-device workflows are table stakes for devs, and if you&#x27;re going to pull something that disruptive, you&#x27;d at least expect a changelog entry or smth.<p>Nope.<p>And just as people started comparing notes and figuring out that the story didn’t quite add up… the main Reddit thread got locked. Then deleted. Like, no public resolution, no real response, just silence.<p>To be clear: this wasn’t an actual policy change, just a backend session bug, and a hallucinated excuse from a support bot that somehow did more damage than the bug itself.<p>But at that point, it didn’t matter. People were already gone.<p>Honestly one of the most surreal product screwups I’ve seen in a while.

These companies are enticed to &#x27;suck up&#x27; to the government because at the end they are business, they need to be in good term with ruling class.<p>you end up with most media complying with the official story pushed by government and friends, and most people believing that because no one has the time to fact check everything.<p>One could argue that the difference with russia is that someone can actually look for real information, but even in russia people have access to vpn to bypass the censorship.<p>Another difference would be that you are allowed to express your opinion, whereas in russia you would be put to jail, that&#x27;s true but only in a very limited way. Since everyone goes on mainstream media and they enforce the government narrative, you can&#x27;t speak there. you are merely allowed to speak out in your little corner out of reach to anyone, and even then since most people believe the government propaganda, your arguments won&#x27;t be heard at all.<p>The more i think about it, the less difference i see.",

I have seen people (one was a VP of Engineering) escorted out of the building, sent in a cab to home along with a security guard (this was in India), not allowed access to computer or talk with other employees. \n But, recently have had a very different experience. The current company I work for announced 30% layoffs. The list was made public within one hour of announcement. The CEO detailed the process of selecting people. The severance was very generous (3-6 months pay) along with health and other benefits. The impacted employees were allowed to keep the laptop and any other assets they took from the company.  They even paid the same severance to contractors.<p>After the announcement, the laid off employees were given a few days in the company to allow them to say good byes. I love the CEOs comment on this &#x27; I trusted them yesterday, I trust them today&#x27;. This was by far the kindest way of laying off employees imo. People were treated with dignity and respect.",

He was one of the best remaining speakers on web topics at the Chrome team (I am still sad about the departure of Paul Lewis and Jake Archibald); and produced a lot of top-notch educational materials (the CSS podcast; the conference talks; the demos).<p>What does this say about Google&#x27;s attitude to web and to Chrome?

I&#x27;ve been through a few myself and it really takes the wind out of your sails. That being said, this sentence made me pause a bit. None of these things mentioned are actually yours. They are the property of Google.<p>One thing that helped me immensely in my career is understanding that my relationship with a company is a business relationship. They pay me for my time and skills and nothing more. Today I can have a job and tomorrow maybe not. I recommended learning how to separate your value from your employer. It&#x27;s not easy but it&#x27;s necessary. I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t enjoy what you do or be excited by it but don&#x27;t fully tether yourself and your well-being to a company.<p>Godspeed!",

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obvious for people outside of google&#x27;s ecosystem just how extraordinarily good the JAX + TPU ecosystem is. Google several structural advantages over other major players, but the largest one is that they roll their own compute solution which is actually very mature and competitive. TPUs are extremely good at both training and inference[1] especially at scale. Google&#x27;s ability to tailor their mature hardware to exactly what they need gives them a massive leg up on competition. AI companies fundamentally have to answer the question &quot;what can you do that no one else can?&quot;. Google&#x27;s hardware advantage provides an actual answer to that question which can&#x27;t be erased the next time someone drops a new model onto huggingface.<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.google&#x2F;products&#x2F;google-cloud&#x2F;ironwood-tpu-age-of-inference&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.google&#x2F;products&#x2F;google-cloud&#x2F;ironwood-tpu-age-o...</a>",

A few are still there but I doubt if they&#x27;ll be around in a year. The main successful product from OpenAI is the ChatGPT app, but there&#x27;s a limit on how much you can charge people for subscription fees. I think soon people expect this service to be provided for free and ads would become the main option to make money out of chatbots. The whole time that I was at OpenAI until now GOOG has been the only individual stock that I&#x27;ve been holding. Despite the threat to their search business I think they&#x27;ll bounce back because they have a lot of cards to play. OpenAI is an annoyance for Google, because they are willing to burn money to get users. Google can&#x27;t as easily burn money, since they already have billions of users, but also they are a public company and have to answer to investors. But I doubt if OpenAI investors would sign up to give more money to be burned in a year. Google just needs to ease off on the red tape and make their innovations available to users as fast as they can. (And don&#x27;t let me get started with Sam Altman.)",

In the family example, rent is very likely to be correlated with food costs - so, if rent is high, food costs are also likely to be high. This skews the distribution - modeling with an unweighted uniform distribution will lead to you being surprised at how improbable the actual outcome was.<p>3) In general normal distributions are rarer than people think - they tend to require some kind of constraining factor on the values to enforce. We see them a bunch in nature because there tends to be negative feedback loops all over the place, but once you leave the relatively tidy garden of Mother Nature for the chaos of human affairs, normal distributions get pretty abnormal.<p>I like this as a tool, and I like the implementation, I’ve just seen a lot of people pick up statistics for the first time and lose a finger.",
